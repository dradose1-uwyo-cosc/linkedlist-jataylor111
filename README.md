## Homework 1
## 1-5-2026 
## Worked with/sources 
* The Go Textbook you provided
* Stack Exchange and Geeks for Geeks for various syntax bugs from learning go
* Go's Website 
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* It mostly just works, however it does have the quirk of I got into a rush and so I don't have some checks that I probably should
* Just finished testing this on the hive and had to change the go.mod version from 1.25.6 to 1.25.5 but I don't know what version the grading is going to be running on because in class we talked about 1.25.6 so I'm going to leave it alone
